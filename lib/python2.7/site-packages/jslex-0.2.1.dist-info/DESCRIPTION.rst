JsLex
=====

A Javascript lexer in Python

Ned Batchelder, http://nedbatchelder.com

JsLex is part of an effort to improve Django's support of localized strings in
Javascript code. It splits Javascript source into a list of tokens.

This makes it more palatable by xgettext in C mode. 

This is a release to PyPI created by Martijn Faassen to make it usable
outside of Django as well.

To run the tests, run "python tests.py".
